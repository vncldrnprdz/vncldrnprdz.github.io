              <h2>Ventilation System with Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T.) for Computer Laboratory</h2>
              <p>
                This thesis project, completed at Southern Luzon State University, focused on designing and developing a 
                <strong>Ventilation System with Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T.)</strong> 
                specifically for computer laboratories. The research addressed the challenge of overheating and energy 
                inefficiency in lab environments by creating a system that could automatically track and analyze laboratory 
                conditions. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The system integrates an <strong>ESP32 microcontroller</strong>, <strong>LM35 temperature sensor</strong>, 
                <strong>PIR motion sensor</strong>, and <strong>IR receiver</strong> to continuously monitor room temperature, 
                detect occupancy, and verify air conditioning status. All gathered data is displayed on an LCD screen, 
                automatically stored in <strong>Google Sheets</strong>, and made accessible through the 
                <strong>Blynk mobile application</strong>. This combination ensures both real-time visibility and remote 
                access to laboratory conditions, allowing users and administrators to make quick, informed decisions. 
              </p>

              <h2>Sharing music and culture through strings.</h2>
              <p>
              My involvement in the Aloysian SMSA Rondalla has been one of the most meaningful creative experiences I have had. 
              Since joining around 2016, I was able to explore music not only as a personal passion but also as a collaborative art form. 
              Performing both traditional and contemporary pieces allowed me to appreciate Filipino culture while developing technical skill, discipline, and teamwork.
              </p>
              <p>
              Being part of the rondalla opened opportunities to perform in a wide variety of settings. 
              I had the privilege of traveling to different places, performing in various institutions to entertain, serenading companies, and serving in churches. 
              Each performance strengthened my confidence as a musician and deepened my understanding of how music can inspire, entertain, and connect people across communities.
              </p>
              <p>
              One of the highlights of my rondalla journey was participating in the <strong>National Music Competitions for Young Artists (NAMCYA)</strong>. 
              Competing at a national level required dedication, rigorous rehearsals, and teamwork, all of which shaped me into a more disciplined and committed artist. 
              This experience enhanced my musical ability and instilled resilience and determination to strive for excellence.
              </p>
              <p>
              Beyond music, being part of the rondalla enriched my social life, allowing me to build friendships, interact with different communities, and share in the joy of collective performance. 
              Under the guidance of our trainers, Nelson Espejo and John Romy Delfin, rondalla was not just an artistic activity, but a cultural and personal journey that strengthened both my creativity and sense of identity.

              <h2>Turning Tassels, Opening Doors</h2>
              <p>
              My graduation marked a defining milestone in my life — a moment where years of dedication, persistence, 
              and sacrifice came together in one significant achievement. It was more than just the end of my academic journey; 
              it symbolized the beginning of countless new possibilities. From early mornings of study to late nights spent 
              completing projects, every challenge I faced, every obstacle I overcame, taught me resilience and built the foundation for this day.  
              Being part of activities, performing, and balancing responsibilities helped me cope with the pressures of college, 
              providing both a creative outlet and a sense of community. With a GPA of 1.4521 and graduating Cum Laude, 
              I carried not just a diploma, but the honor of representing my perseverance and commitment.
              </p>
              <p>
              This achievement was never mine alone. It was shaped by the unwavering support of family, the encouragement of mentors, 
              and the camaraderie of peers who shared the same struggles and triumphs.  
              We all faced our own battles — stress, exhaustion, self-doubt, and countless unseen challenges — yet we showed up, persisted, 
              and kept going. Every late night, every deadline, every challenge faced with determination, contributed to this moment.  
              Walking across that stage was not just a ceremonial gesture — it was a celebration of growth, of silent battles endured, 
              and of victories earned through steadfast commitment.
              </p>
              <p>
              As the tassel turned, it was not only the end of one chapter but the beginning of a journey forward.  
              It reminded me that life is not always about having everything figured out; it’s about courage, persistence, and refusing to give up.  
              Education is more than lessons in a classroom — it is a lifelong journey of learning, growing, and striving to make an impact.  
              This milestone is a constant reminder that with determination, faith, and resilience, even the most challenging paths 
              can lead to remarkable destinations. I rode the ride, faced the challenges, and I’m still here — stronger, wiser, and ready for what comes next.  
              It was truly a <strong><em>ride or die</em></strong> experience.

              <h2>A Majestic Journey into Information Trends and Specialized Technology.</h2>
              <p>
                Attending <em>TechVolution Unleashed</em> was an enriching experience that deepened my
                understanding of the rapidly evolving world of technology. The seminar, held at SLSU–CTE AVR,
                highlighted three pivotal areas shaping the digital landscape today:
                <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, <strong>Advanced Excel</strong>, and
                <strong>Cyber Analytics</strong>. Each session provided valuable insights into how these tools
                and disciplines are transforming industries, fostering innovation, and redefining
                problem-solving in the modern age.
              </p>
              <p>
                The discussion on <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> explored its applications in various
                fields, from business decision-making to everyday automation. Learning about machine learning,
                natural language processing, and computer vision broadened my perspective on how AI drives
                efficiency and innovation. This reinforced the importance of embracing AI as a means of staying
                relevant in the digital era.
              </p>
              <p>
                The session on <strong>Advanced Excel</strong> was equally impactful, equipping participants with
                the ability to handle complex datasets through advanced formulas, pivot tables, and data
                modeling. These techniques demonstrated how powerful Excel can be for analytics and
                visualization, enabling professionals to derive meaningful insights that inform better
                decision-making.
              </p>
              <p>
                The segment on <strong>Cybersecurity Awareness</strong> emphasized the urgent need for robust
                cybersecurity practices. By exploring cyber threats, risk assessments, and defensive strategies,
                I gained a deeper awareness of safeguarding sensitive information in an interconnected world.
                This session not only strengthened my technical awareness but also underscored the
                responsibility of maintaining secure digital environments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond technical knowledge, the seminar fostered collaboration, curiosity, and active engagement
                among participants. The interactive discussions and knowledge-sharing with experts created an
                inspiring learning environment that bridged the gap between academia and industry. Overall,
                <em>TechVolution Unleashed</em> empowered me with the skills, awareness, and confidence to adapt
                to technological trends and apply them in real-world contexts.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the <strong>facilitator</strong> and <strong>president of the class</strong>, I was in charge of everything—from
                the smallest tasks to the biggest responsibilities. It was a very challenging role, since I had
                to make critical decisions and ensure that everything ran smoothly. At times, I felt overwhelmed,
                but with the support of my team and classmates, we pushed through every difficulty. In the end,
                the success of the seminar made all the hard work and effort worthwhile.

              <h2>Creative modeling for practical use.</h2>
              <p>
              This project showcases an <strong>automated RC car pet feeder</strong>, created as a 3D prototype 
              for demonstration purposes. Using <strong>CAD-based 3D modeling</strong>, I translated the client’s 
              physical prototype into a digital format that could be easily presented to panel respondents, advisers, 
              and other stakeholders. Although the model does not include wire connections or the complete internal 
              mechanisms, it reflects exactly what the client requested for visualization and discussion purposes.

                          The 3D model looked so realistic that it felt like we were looking at the actual prototype itself, only more refined 
                          and beautiful. The details were sharp, clear, and super HD, making it easy for our panel to visualize the concept with confidence.

              AutoCAD, allowing the digital model to be proportional and realistic. I also applied rendering 
              techniques to enhance graphics, providing a clearer and more engaging visual for presentations. 
              This approach allows viewers to understand the design, functionality, and mobility of the concept 
              without needing the fully operational device.

              <h2>Supporting academic initiatives and advocacy.</h2>
              <p>
                  In 2023, I was nominated for the position of President in the 
                  Association of Computer Technology Students (ACTS). While it was an 
                  honor to be considered for the highest role in our academic organization, 
                  I recognized early on that balancing such a demanding responsibility with 
                  my studies, part-time work, other organizational duties, and the daily 
                  challenge of commuting to school would be overwhelming. For these reasons, 
                  I respectfully declined the presidency.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fortunately, I was still given the opportunity to serve as the 
                  <strong>Year Representative</strong> for my batch. Though the role came 
                  with fewer tasks compared to the presidency, it was still a challenging 
                  position. As representative, I was tasked to act as the liaison between my 
                  classmates and the ACTS Executive Board, ensuring that academic and 
                  technical concerns were voiced and addressed. I also helped coordinate and 
                  support seminars, workshops, and competitions that promoted digital innovation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the biggest challenges was collaborating with other year-level 
                  representatives and leaders. It required strong communication, flexibility, 
                  and leadership to bridge differences and push forward initiatives for the 
                  good of the student body. Despite the difficulties, the experience taught 
                  me how to manage responsibilities under pressure, work with diverse groups, 
                  and remain committed to both academic and organizational goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Being part of ACTS gave me not just a leadership role, but also an 
                  opportunity to grow — balancing my personal limitations while still 
                  contributing to something larger than myself.

              <h2>Shaped by discipline, values, and lifelong friendships.</h2>
              <p>
                In 2015, I entered the <strong>Sisters of Mary School – Adlas, Inc.</strong> in Silang, Cavite. 
                It was a place unlike any other — a boarding school where thousands of young boys like me lived, 
                studied, and grew together. Life there was strict but meaningful. We only had 
                <strong>one visiting day each year</strong> to see our families, and just 
                <strong>two to three weeks of vacation</strong> before returning to campus. 
                Communication with the outside world was almost nonexistent — we were allowed to send just 
                <strong>one letter per year</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yet, despite being away from my family, those years turned out to be some of the 
                <strong>best years of my life</strong>. Inside the walls of the campus, I learned the values 
                that continue to guide me today — discipline, faith, perseverance, and gratitude. 
                I met friends who became like brothers, bonds that I know will last a lifetime. 
                We shared everything — the struggles, the laughter, and the dreams of building a better future.
              </p>
              <p>
                The institution gave me opportunities I never thought I’d have. I was a 
                <strong>constant academic awardee</strong>, even reaching <strong>Top 4 in my batch</strong>. 
                I served as a <strong>class officer multiple times</strong>, took part in competitions, and 
                received several awards and recognitions. Beyond academics, I got to experience things that 
                both the rich and poor could relate to — the joy of trips outside campus, the excitement of 
                learning new skills, and the sense of accomplishment in every achievement.
              </p>
              <p>
                During my stay, I also became a <strong>student teacher</strong>, handling lessons in 
                <strong>AutoCAD 2D and 3D</strong> whenever no teacher was available. This role gave me the 
                chance to share knowledge while honing my own technical skills. 
                I actively attended <strong>seminars, workshops, and trainings</strong>, joined student 
                organizations, and even served as an <strong>officer</strong> in some of them — 
                experiences that taught me responsibility, leadership, and service.
              </p>
              <p>
                Looking back, the restrictions didn’t matter — no phones, no internet, no constant contact 
                with the outside world. What mattered was what we gained inside: values, friendships, 
                experiences, and a stronger sense of who we are. For me, 
                <strong>The Sisters of Mary – Adlas, Inc.</strong> was not just a school. 
                It was a home, a training ground for life, and the place that shaped me into the person I am today.

              <h2>Spreading harmony across communities.</h2>
              <p>
              Joining the SLSU College Rondalla in 2022 was a truly rewarding experience for me.  
              Because of my prior experience in high school with the Aloysian SMSA Rondalla,  
              I quickly advanced to an active member within a few months.  
              Although I didn’t own a personal instrument, the group generously allowed me to borrow one to practice at home.  
              This opportunity gave me a chance to immerse myself in music while developing my skills and adapting to new challenges.  
              Being part of rondalla also helped me cope with the challenges I faced during my college days,  
              providing a creative outlet and a supportive community whenever I felt stressed or overwhelmed.
              </p>
              <p>
              Being part of the ensemble allowed me to perform in various venues and institutions,  
              including prestigious spaces like the University of the Philippines.  
              Traveling to different places and performing for diverse audiences helped me grow as a musician and as a collaborator.  
              Each performance taught me how music can entertain, inspire, and foster connections between people from different backgrounds.
              </p>
              <p>
              One memorable aspect of my time in rondalla was working closely with our trainers,  
              El Doulos Chua and Ma. Via Isabel Hari.  
              Their guidance and encouragement pushed me to refine my technique, practice consistently, and approach each piece with dedication.  
              Through rehearsals and shared performances, I learned the importance of teamwork, patience, and creative expression in a collective musical setting.
              </p>
              <p>
              Beyond honing musical skills, being part of rondalla enriched my personal growth.  
              I formed lasting friendships, experienced new cultural environments, and gained confidence in sharing music with others.  
              Ultimately, my journey in rondalla was more than just performing —  
              it became a meaningful exploration of creativity, culture, and community.

              <h2>Promoting education and faith through visuals.</h2>
              <p>
              During my time working with the <strong>Diocese of Ilagan Catechists</strong>, I took on a dynamic role 
              in creating visual media that supported the church’s weekly activities, special events, and catechetical 
              initiatives. Each week, I produced videos featuring the readings, gospels, and reflections, ensuring that 
              parishioners could engage meaningfully with the messages even if they could not attend in person.
              </p>
              <p>
              Beyond the weekly content, I was responsible for documenting and producing videos for Catholic events, 
              capturing the atmosphere, key moments, and highlights of each occasion. From local parish celebrations 
              to diocesan programs, I combined photos, audio, and video clips to create cohesive and engaging 
              presentations. My role often required careful editing, trimming, and syncing of multiple media sources to 
              ensure each video was polished and ready for public sharing.
              </p>
              <p>
              The busiest months were October through December, coinciding with the Catechetical Month, All Saints’ 
              Day, and Christmas celebrations. During this time, I managed a high volume of content production while 
              maintaining attention to detail and storytelling quality.
              </p>
              <p>
              Occasionally, when my contact person or supervisor was unavailable or traveling, I also handled posting 
              content directly to the official Facebook page, ensuring that updates were timely and audiences remained 
              engaged. This responsibility required both technical skill and a strong sense of initiative.
              </p>
              <p>
              Overall, this experience strengthened my abilities in video production, multimedia editing, and content 
              management, while also teaching me the importance of consistency, organization, and creativity in 
              supporting faith-based initiatives. It was both a challenging and rewarding opportunity to contribute to 
              the mission of the Diocese of Ilagan.
